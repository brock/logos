So you're ready to make a logo for [io.js]? Awesome! Here is what you should do:

1. Fork this repository
2. Make an awesome logo! Looking for inspiration, there is already a huge discussion [over on io.js itself](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/37).
3. Add the appropriate files for your logo:
  - 500px x 500px PNG render.
  - 60px x 60px PNG render _(to see how it looks small)._
  - Examples on both light and dark backgrounds.
  - _Optional, but recommended._ SVG source (or other vector format).
4. Put all these files under `/logos/your-awesome-logo-name/`
5. Submit a pull-request.
